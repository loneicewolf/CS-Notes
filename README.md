## Plans
- Self Learnable AI
- Generation AI (Picture,Code,Text,Other-AI) 
  - Picture (like mid journey,stable diffusion, DALL / E) 
  - Code
  - Text 
  - Other-AI (AI makes AI which makes AI (..)) <- yes. A fun project

## Storage And Retrieval 
# Knowledge Capsules
- (insert -> to insert a specific knowledge, or to insert a empty capsule for knowledge storage & retrieval)
- (eject -> to retrieve knowledge)
think of it like "save" or "checkpoint"!

## Cluster AI's
- Clusters of AI's using ONE prompt!
- prompt(s)
  - 1 "Search the web for (...)"
- replies: 
  - AI_MODEL_1:  answer to 1 = (..)
  - AI_MODEL_2:  answer to 1 = (..)
  - AI_MODEL_3:  answer to 1 = (..)
